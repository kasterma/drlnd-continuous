# Report: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Actions

In this project we are learning how to operate a robot arm with two joints (think shoulder and elbow).  The arm
functions as two pendulums attached together (if you stop applying force, gravity will pull the arm to point straigth
down; you can see this by applying some random actions followed by the all zero actions).  We are using the
DDPG, _d_eep _d_eterministic _p_olicy _g_radient, algorithm (from Continous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning,
Lillicrap et al [archiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)).  Our implementation is heavily based on a provided
reference implementation
